# In this repository, I explore and try out Java 8 specific features.

## Functional Interfaces

A single abstract method interface, with as many default and static methods, is called a functional interface. 
Java 8 provides a way of declaring an interface as a functional interface with the _@FunctionalInterface_ annotation.
Coupled with lambdas, which provide a cleaner and more compact implementation of such interfaces, java code becomes more readable than it used to be.

In this project, I illustrate the effectiveness of lambdas when used to implement a functional interface as opposed to the traditional _anonymous class_.
