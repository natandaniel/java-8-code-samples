# Java 8 Code Samples

In this repository, I provide quick glances of what you can do with Java 8.

## [Functional Interfaces](https://github.com/natandaniel/java-8-code-samples/tree/master/src/main/java/funcint)

A **single abstract method interface**, with as many default and static methods, is called **a functional interface**. 
Java 8 provides a way of declaring an interface as a functional interface with the **_@FunctionalInterface_** annotation.
Coupled with **lambdas**, which provide a cleaner and more compact implementation of such interfaces, java code becomes more readable than it used to be. Such objects assimilate to functions and provide a functional way of coding. Java 8 also provides built in functional interfaces.

## [Method References](https://github.com/natandaniel/java-8-code-samples/tree/master/src/main/java/method/references)

Method references provide a way to refer to class static methods or instance methods and are alternatives to lambdas for functional interfaces' implementations.

## [Streams](https://github.com/natandaniel/java-8-code-samples/tree/master/src/main/java/stream)

Streams enable us to manipulate collections without creating intermediary storage. Java 8 introduces many stream functions allowing to map, filter or sort elements in collections.
