# Java 8 Features

## [Functional Interface](https://github.com/natandaniel/java8/tree/master/java_8_features/src/functional/interfaces)

A **single abstract method interface**, with as many default and static methods, is called **a functional interface**. 
Java 8 provides a way of declaring an interface as a functional interface with the **_@FunctionalInterface_** annotation.
Coupled with **lambdas**, which provide a cleaner and more compact implementation of such interfaces, java code becomes more readable than it used to be. Such objects assimilate to functions and provide a functional way of coding. Java 8 also provides built in functional interfaces.
