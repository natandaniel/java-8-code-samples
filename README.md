# Java 8 Code Samples

## [Lambdas](https://github.com/natandaniel/java8/tree/master/java_8_features/src/lambdas)

## [Functional Interfaces](https://github.com/natandaniel/java8/tree/master/java_8_features/src/funcint)

A **single abstract method interface**, with as many default and static methods, is called **a functional interface**. 
Java 8 provides a way of declaring an interface as a functional interface with the **_@FunctionalInterface_** annotation.
Coupled with **lambdas**, which provide a cleaner and more compact implementation of such interfaces, java code becomes more readable than it used to be. Such objects assimilate to functions and provide a functional way of coding. Java 8 also provides built in functional interfaces.

## [Method References](https://github.com/natandaniel/java8/tree/master/java_8_features/src/method/references)

Method references provide a way to refer to class static methods or instance methods and are alternatives to lambdas for functional interfaces' implementations.
